# 🧪 Experiment 1: Transformer Encoder – Autoencoding (Masked Language Model)

## 📌 Objective
To understand and implement a Transformer Encoder and study:
- Self-Attention mechanism
- Autoencoding using Masked Language Modeling (MLM)
- Text reconstruction using masked words
- Visualization of attention weights

---

## 📖 Problem Statement
1. Given an input sentence with a masked word (`[MASK]`), reconstruct the missing word.
2. Use a Transformer Encoder to learn contextual relationships between words.
3. Visualize self-attention weights to understand how the model focuses on different words.

Example:  
Input  : Transformers use [MASK] attention  
Output : Transformers use self attention  

---

## 📂 Dataset
The experiment uses a dataset of 10 masked sentences.

ID | Masked Input Sentence | Expected Output
---|----------------------|----------------
1 | Transformers use [MASK] attention | self
2 | Mars is called the [MASK] planet | red
3 | Online learning improves [MASK] access | educational
4 | Exercise improves [MASK] health | mental
5 | Cricket is a [MASK] sport | popular
6 | Python is a [MASK] language | programming
7 | Neural networks have [MASK] layers | hidden
8 | Trees reduce [MASK] pollution | air
9 | Robots perform [MASK] tasks | repetitive
10 | Solar power is a [MASK] source | renewable

## 🔍 Autoencoding with Masked Language Model
Masked Language Modeling replaces one word in the sentence with `[MASK]`.  
The Transformer Encoder predicts the masked word using surrounding context, enabling autoencoding without recurrence.

---

## 🔬 Self-Attention Mechanism
Self-attention allows each word to attend to every other word in the sentence, capturing global dependencies efficiently.

## 📊 Attention Visualization

Below is the self-attention heatmap generated by the Transformer Encoder:

![Self-Attention Heatmap](results/attention_heatmap.png)

The heatmap shows how each word attends to others in the sentence.  
Brighter colors indicate stronger attention, explaining how the masked token uses surrounding context.
